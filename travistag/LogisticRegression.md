###Instructions
Use 'testlogreg.py DIR' to get the CSV file, given the directory of pictures to predict.

challenge1.py trains the model and outputs it to the logreg*.pkl files, which are opened by the testlogreg.
It takes about 30s to generate the model and output it.

I used 20 random images as cross-validation and got about 75% accuracy.
